## OpenMarch Sync

When March3D is connected to OpenMarch, it can:

- Automatically open the `.dots` file currently loaded in OpenMarch
- Follow OpenMarch playback
- Follow OpenMarch play/pause state
- Follow timeline position
- Reload when the OpenMarch drill changes

The installer automatically installs the March3D OpenMarch sync plugin to:

```text
%APPDATA%\OpenMarch\plugins
```

## Requirements

For development:

- Node.js
- npm
- Windows, macOS, or Linux for development
- Windows for building the Windows installer

End users do **not** need Node.js or npm.

## Development

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd March3D
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development version:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Build

Build the application:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Build Windows Installer

To create a Windows installer:

```bash
npm install
npm run dist:win
```

The installer will be generated in:

## `.dots` Files

March3D reads OpenMarch `.dots` files directly.

It uses drill information including:

- Marcher positions
- Sections
- Pages / sets
- Beats
- Tempo
- Field dimensions
- Field checkpoints
- Yard number positions
- Hash positions
- Audio information

## Windows Installer

March3D uses Electron Builder with NSIS to create a normal Windows installer.

The installer can:

- Install March3D
- Create a Desktop shortcut
- Create a Start Menu shortcut
- Install the OpenMarch sync plugin
- Remove the plugin when March3D is uninstalled

## OpenMarch Plugin Location

The March3D sync plugin is installed to:

```text
%APPDATA%\OpenMarch\plugins\March3DSync.om.js
```

Restart OpenMarch after installing or updating March3D so the latest plugin version is loaded.

## Current Version

**March3D v0.3.33**

## Status

March3D is currently in active development.

Some features, models, animation behavior, and OpenMarch synchronization may change as development continues.

## Credits

March3D is designed to work alongside OpenMarch.

OpenMarch is a separate project and is not bundled with March3D.
